STEP 1-
Heat oven to 200C. Tear 4 pieces of white bread into big, ragged croutons or, if you prefer, cut with a bread knife. Spread over a large baking sheet or tray and sprinkle over 2 tbsp olive oil. 

STEP 2- 
Rub the oil into the bread and season it with a little salt if you like. Bake for 8-10 mins, turning the croutons a few times during cooking so they brown evenly.

STEP 3-
Rub the 2 chicken breasts with 1 tbsp olive oil, and season. Place pan over medium heat for 1 min, until hot, but not smoking. Lay the chicken on the pan and leave it for 4 mins.

STEP 4-
Turn the chicken, then cook for 4 mins more. Check if it's cooked by poking the tip of a sharp knife into the thickest part; there should be no sign of pink and juices will run clear.

STEP 5-
Bash 1 garlic clove with the flat of the knife and peel of the skin. Crush with a garlic crusher. Mash 2 anchovies with a fork against the side of a small bowl.

STEP 7- 
Grate a handful of parmesan cheese and mix with the garlic, anchovies, 5 tbsp mayonnaise and 1 tbsp vinegar. Season to taste. It should be the consistency of yogurt- if yours is thicker, stir in a few tsps water to thin it.

STEP 6-
Shave the cheese with a peeler. Tear 1 large lettuce into large pieces and put in a large bowl.Pull chicken into bite-size strips and scatter half over the leaves, along with half the croutons.

STEP 8-
Add most of the dressing and toss with your fingers. Scatter the rest of the chicken and croutons, then drizzle with the remaining dressing. Sprinkle the parmesan on top and serve straight away.

RECIPE TIP-
Add bacon, avacado, or tuna, whichever you like by your taste, instead of chicken!
